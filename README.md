# **Enhancement of Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR) of Lunar Craters Captured by OHRC of Chandrayaan-2**  

This project focuses on enhancing low-light images of permanently shadowed regions (PSR) of lunar craters captured by the **Orbiter High-Resolution Camera (OHRC)** of **Chandrayaan-2**. The goal is to improve the **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** for better interpretation and analysis of these challenging datasets.  

## **Overview**  

**Lunar Image Processing Tool** is a **desktop software** that enables users to efficiently process and analyze **ISRO Chandrayaan-2 OHRC images**. The tool automates image enhancement and conversion processes while allowing **partial or full image processing** using advanced algorithms. The primary aim is to enhance the visibility and clarity of lunar crater images, especially in **dimly lit PSR areas**.  

## **Key Features**  

### 1. **Seamless Input Handling**  
- Users can directly **input OHRC zip files** downloaded from the **CHMapBrowser**.  
- The software **automatically extracts and processes data** for analysis.  

### 2. **Automated GeoTIFF Conversion**  
- Effortlessly **converts lunar surface image data** into **high-resolution GeoTIFF format**.
- Includes **spatial metadata** for **precise geospatial analysis**, enabling integration with **GIS tools**.  

### 3. **Full Image Enhancement**  
- Enhances the **entire lunar surface** using **advanced image processing algorithms**.  
- Improves **overall image quality and clarity** for better interpretation of lunar features.  

### 4. **Partial Image Enhancement**  
- Users can **select specific regions of interest** using **bounding boxes**.  
- Only the **selected areas** are enhanced, allowing for focused analysis while keeping the rest of the image untouched.  

### 5. **Advanced Image Processing Techniques**  
The software employs the following **image enhancement algorithms**:  
- **Single Scale Retinex (SSR)**  
- **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**  
- **Gaussian Blur**  
- **Denoising**  

## **How to Use**  

1. Download the OHRC image zip file from: [CHMapBrowser](https://chmapbrowse.issdc.gov.in/MapBrowse/).  
2. Use the **desktop software** to input the zip files.  
3. Select either **full image enhancement** or **partial enhancement** (using bounding boxes).  
4. Run the enhancement process.  
5. The **enhanced image** will be saved as a **GeoTIFF** for further analysis.  

## **Future Enhancements**  

- Adding more **image processing techniques** for **better edge detection** and **crater analysis**.  
- Integrating **machine learning models** for **automated crater and boulder detection**.  
- Improving the **user interface** for a more seamless experience.
